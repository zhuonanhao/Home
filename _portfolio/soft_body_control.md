## Real-time simulation enabled navigation control of magnetic soft continuum robots in confined lumens
**Overview:** In this work, we develop a real-time numerical framework to simulate the mechanical behavior of magnetic soft continuum robots (MSCRs), incorporating (i) geometric nonlinearity, (ii) magnetic actuation, and (iii) contact interactions within confined lumens. Leveraging this real-time simulation, we implement a model-based control for MSCRs in constrained environments to minimize the tip contact force and enhance navigation accuracy. Finally, we validate our framework through extensive numerical simulations and experimental studies, demonstrating its robustness, efficiency, and accuracy. Our work addresses key challenges in MSCR navigation control, paving the way for safer and more reliable clinical translation of this technology for interventional surgeries.
